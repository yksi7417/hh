# Navigator Component Integration

## Overview
Successfully ported the Navigator component from `imgui_basic` to `imgui_opengl_glad`, enabling both the Navigator and MarketDataTable to share the same data source (HostContext and HostMDSlot).

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Navigator Component (`imgui_opengl_glad/ui/`)

#### `Navigator.h`
- **Data Source Integration**: Modified to accept `HostContext& ctx` and `HostMDSlot& slot` parameters
- **Statistics Tracking**: Added `DataStats` struct to cache real-time statistics:
  - Total rows, buy/sell counts
  - Total quantity, average price
  - Dirty rows (recently updated)
- **Tree-based UI**: Provides hierarchical navigation with:
  - Data Categories (by side, price range, activity)
  - Statistics (aggregated metrics)
  - Quick Filters (predefined views)

#### `Navigator.cpp`
- **Real-time Data Analysis**: `UpdateStatistics()` processes live market data
  - Counts buy/sell orders from `slot.side[]`
  - Calculates total quantity from `slot.qty[]`
  - Computes average price from `slot.px_n[]`
  - Tracks dirty rows from `ctx.dirty[]`
- **Three Main Sections**:
  1. **Data Categories Tree**: Groups data by side, price range, and activity
  2. **Statistics Tree**: Shows real-time metrics and queue stats
  3. **Quick Filters Tree**: Provides common filter shortcuts

### 2. Updated ImGuiComponents (`imgui_opengl_glad/ui/`)

#### `IMGuiComponents.h`
- Added `#include "Navigator.h"`
- Added member: `std::unique_ptr<Navigator> navigator_;`

#### `IMGuiComponents.cpp`
- **Initialization**: Creates Navigator instance and initializes with `ctx.num_rows`
- **Update Loop**: Renders both Navigator and MarketDataTable in the main update loop
- **Shared Data**: Both components access the same `HostContext& ctx` and `HostMDSlot& slot`
- **Cleanup**: Properly resets Navigator on shutdown

### 3. Updated Build System

#### `CMakeLists.txt`
- Added `ui/Navigator.cpp` and `ui/Navigator.h` to the `emsp` executable sources
- Navigator is compiled as part of the main GUI application

## Key Features

### Data Sharing Architecture
```
HostContext & HostMDSlot (Shared Data Source)
            |
            +---> Navigator (Tree View)
            |       - Categories
            |       - Statistics
            |       - Quick Filters
            |
            +---> MarketDataTable (Table View)
                    - Real-time updates
                    - Filtering/Sorting
                    - Grouping
```

### Navigator Display Elements

1. **Data Categories**
   - **By Side**: Buy Orders (green) vs Sell Orders (red) with counts
   - **By Price Range**: Low/Mid/High price brackets with distribution
   - **By Activity**: Active (recently updated) vs Inactive rows

2. **Statistics**
   - Total Rows
   - Total Quantity (sum of all `qty` values)
   - Average Price (calculated from `px_n` values)
   - Buy/Sell percentages
   - Recently Updated count
   - Queue statistics (capacity, head, tail)

3. **Quick Filters** (Placeholders for future functionality)
   - Show All
   - Show Buy Only
   - Show Sell Only
   - Show Large Orders (Qty > 1000)
   - Show Recent Updates

## Technical Highlights

### Performance
- **Zero-copy design**: Navigator doesn't copy data, only reads from shared buffers
- **Efficient statistics**: Calculated once per render frame
- **Lock-free access**: Reads from atomic queue statistics safely

### Integration
- **Docking Support**: Navigator is a dockable window that can be positioned anywhere
- **Consistent API**: Uses same parameter pattern as MarketDataTable
- **Shared Lifecycle**: Initialized, updated, and cleaned up alongside MarketDataTable

## Testing

### Build Results
```bash
.\build_gui.bat
# ✓ GUI build completed successfully
# ✓ Navigator.cpp compiled without errors
# ✓ Executable created: build_gui/Debug/emsp.exe
```

### Runtime Results
```bash
.\emsp.exe
# Host (console) rows=10000 writers=2 updates/sec=50000
# ✓ Application runs successfully
# ✓ Navigator displays market data categories
# ✓ MarketDataTable shows real-time updates
# ✓ Both components share the same data source
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Interactive Filtering
- Make Quick Filters functional (filter MarketDataTable from Navigator)
- Add callback mechanism from Navigator to MarketDataTable
- Implement two-way communication for coordinated views

### Phase 2: Advanced Navigation
- Add bookmarks and favorites
- Historical data views
- Custom category definitions
- Search functionality

### Phase 3: Visualization
- Mini charts in Navigator tree
- Sparklines for trends
- Color-coded health indicators
- Alert notifications

## Differences from Original `imgui_basic` Navigator

### Removed Features
- Generic categories (Electronics, Clothing, etc.) - Not relevant for market data
- Customer/Reports trees - Not applicable to trading data

### Added Features
- Real-time market data statistics
- Buy/Sell side categorization
- Price range grouping
- Activity tracking (dirty rows)
- Queue statistics display
- Shared data source integration

### Architectural Improvements
- Works with OpenGL instead of DirectX 11
- Integrates with existing CMake build system
- Uses modern C++17 patterns (unique_ptr, etc.)
- Consistent with imgui_opengl_glad architecture

## Conclusion

The Navigator component has been successfully ported and integrated into `imgui_opengl_glad`. Both the Navigator and MarketDataTable now share the same data source (HostContext and HostMDSlot), providing complementary views of the real-time market data:

- **Navigator**: Hierarchical tree view for categorization and statistics
- **MarketDataTable**: Detailed table view for data inspection and manipulation

The components work together seamlessly in a dockable UI, maintaining the high-performance zero-copy architecture of the application.
