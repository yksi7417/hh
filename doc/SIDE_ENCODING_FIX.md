# Bug Fix: Side Encoding Mismatch - Complete Fix

## Issue Description
The Navigator and MarketDataTable were showing different counts for Buy/Sell orders:
- **MarketDataTable**: Showed 5111 Buy, 4889 Sell
- **Navigator**: Showed 4889 Buy, 0 Sell

The numbers were swapped and one showed 0, indicating they were not interpreting the side field correctly.

## Root Cause
**THREE components** were using incorrect encoding schemes for the `side` field:

### Incorrect Encodings (OLD):
1. **MarketDataTable**: `0 = Buy, 1 = Sell` ❌
2. **md_plugin.cpp**: `0 = Buy, 1 = Sell` ❌
3. **Navigator**: Was using correct encoding `1 = Buy, 2 = Sell` ✓

### Correct (API Specification from md_api.h):
```c
uint8_t* side;   // 0=unk, 1=bid, 2=ask, 3=trade
```

So the correct encoding is:
- `0` = Unknown
- `1` = Bid (Buy)
- `2` = Ask (Sell)
- `3` = Trade

## The Complete Fix

### Fixed Files:

1. **`imgui_opengl_glad/ui/MarketDataTable.cpp`**
   - Updated `GetSideString()` to use correct encoding: `1=Buy, 2=Sell, 3=Trade, 0=Unknown`
   - Updated `GetSideColor()` to match:
     - `1` (Buy/Bid) = Green
     - `2` (Sell/Ask) = Red
     - `3` (Trade) = Blue
     - `0` (Unknown) = Gray

2. **`imgui_opengl_glad/plugins/md_plugin.cpp`** ⚠️ CRITICAL FIX
   - Changed side initialization from `std::uniform_int_distribution<int> side_pick(0, 1)` 
   - To: `std::uniform_int_distribution<int> side_pick(1, 2)`
   - Now generates correct values: `1 = Buy (bid), 2 = Sell (ask)`

3. **`imgui_opengl_glad/ui/Navigator.h`**
   - Added `unknown_count` and `trade_count` to DataStats
   - Now tracks all 4 possible side values

4. **`imgui_opengl_glad/ui/Navigator.cpp`**
   - Updated `UpdateStatistics()` to use switch statement for all 4 side values
   - Enhanced `RenderDataCategoriesTree()` to show:
     - Unknown (gray) - only if count > 0
     - Buy Orders (green)
     - Sell Orders (red)
     - Trades (blue) - only if count > 0
   - Enhanced `RenderStatisticsTree()` to display all side categories with percentages

5. **`imgui_opengl_glad/tests/guitests/app_gui_test.cpp`**
   - Fixed test data generation from `i % 2` (gives 0,1) to `(i % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 2` (gives 1,2)

## Verification
✅ All 11 tests pass after the fix
✅ All components now use the same API specification
✅ Side counts now match between Navigator and MarketDataTable
✅ md_plugin now generates correct side values (1 and 2)
✅ Navigator displays all 4 possible side categories

## Impact
- **Breaking Change**: Data generated before this fix used incorrect side values (0,1 instead of 1,2)
- **Data Consistency**: Navigator and MarketDataTable now correctly share the same data source and interpret it identically
- **API Compliance**: All code now matches the official `md_api.h` specification
- **Enhanced Navigator**: Now shows Unknown and Trade categories when present

## Testing
Run the GUI application and verify:
1. ✓ Navigator "By Side" counts match MarketDataTable filter counts exactly
2. ✓ Buy orders show in green (both components)
3. ✓ Sell orders show in red (both components)
4. ✓ The totals add up correctly (buy + sell = total rows)
5. ✓ Navigator shows all side types: Unknown (if any), Buy, Sell, Trades (if any)

```bash
# Run automated tests
cd imgui_opengl_glad\tests\guitests\build\Debug
.\simple_gui_test.exe --headless

# Expected: Total Tests: 11, Passed: 11, Failed: 0
```

## What Changed in Navigator Display

### "By Side" Tree (Data Categories):
- **Before**: Only showed Buy and Sell
- **After**: Shows all 4 categories:
  - Unknown (gray) - conditionally shown if count > 0
  - Buy Orders (green) - always shown
  - Sell Orders (red) - always shown  
  - Trades (blue) - conditionally shown if count > 0

### Statistics Section:
- **Before**: Only showed Buy and Sell percentages
- **After**: Shows all categories with percentages:
  - Unknown (if any)
  - Buy Orders
  - Sell Orders
  - Trades (if any)
