# UI Test Build Fix

## Issue
The `build_ui_test.bat` script failed after integrating the Navigator component because the GUI test CMakeLists.txt was missing the new `Navigator.cpp` source file.

## Root Cause
When `IMGuiComponents.cpp` was updated to include `Navigator.h` and instantiate a Navigator object, the GUI tests build configuration in `imgui_opengl_glad/tests/guitests/CMakeLists.txt` was not updated to include the corresponding `Navigator.cpp` implementation file.

## Solution
Updated `imgui_opengl_glad/tests/guitests/CMakeLists.txt` to include `Navigator.cpp` in the `APP_SOURCES` list:

```cmake
# Application source files (for testing the real GUI)
set(APP_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../..)
set(APP_SOURCES
    ${APP_DIR}/ui/IMGuiComponents.cpp
    ${APP_DIR}/ui/MarketDataTable.cpp
    ${APP_DIR}/ui/Navigator.cpp           # <-- ADDED
    ${APP_DIR}/core/data_updater.cpp
)
```

## Verification

### Build Results
```bash
.\build_ui_test.bat
# ✓ CMake configuration successful
# ✓ Navigator.cpp compiled successfully
# ✓ GUI test executable created: simple_gui_test.exe
```

### Test Results
```bash
.\simple_gui_test.exe --headless
# Total Tests: 6
# Passed: 6
# Failed: 0
# ✓ All tests passed
```

## Files Modified
- `imgui_opengl_glad/tests/guitests/CMakeLists.txt` - Added Navigator.cpp to APP_SOURCES

## Related Files
- `imgui_opengl_glad/ui/Navigator.cpp` - Navigator implementation
- `imgui_opengl_glad/ui/Navigator.h` - Navigator header
- `imgui_opengl_glad/ui/IMGuiComponents.cpp` - Uses Navigator

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. GUI tests can build successfully with the new Navigator component
2. All 6 existing GUI tests continue to pass
3. The test infrastructure is ready for future Navigator-specific tests
4. CI/CD pipelines will work correctly

## Best Practice
When adding new components to the main application (`imgui_opengl_glad/CMakeLists.txt`), remember to also update the GUI test build configuration (`tests/guitests/CMakeLists.txt`) if the new component is used by tested modules like `IMGuiComponents`.
